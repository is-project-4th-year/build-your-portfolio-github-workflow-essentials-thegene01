## 3. Learnings from the Git Crash Program

Concept: Git & GitHub Basics

Expectation 👀: Thought Git was just a command-line tool for “saving code” and GitHub was just storage.

Reality 😅: Git tracks every change like a time machine, and GitHub is like Google Drive but for code, with collaboration built in.

Impact 💡: Helped me recover old versions of my portfolio when I made mistakes and made collaboration possible.

Concept: Branching

Expectation 👀: Sounded like something only senior developers or big tech teams use.

Reality 😅: Turns out it’s super helpful even for solo projects! Branches let me experiment without messing up the main site.

Impact 💡: I confidently created a branch to test mobile layouts without fear of breaking the live version.

Concept: Merge Conflicts

Expectation 👀: Thought they were rare and super complex to fix.

Reality 😅: Conflicts happen often even when working alone but VS Code highlights them clearly and resolving is just editing and choosing the correct lines.

Impact 💡: Helped me understand version control better and gave me more confidence working across multiple branches.

Concept: GitHub Project Boards

Expectation 👀: I assumed it was a complex project management tool meant only for large development teams.

Reality 😅: It turned out to be a simple, visual way to manage tasks like a digital sticky-note board. Moving tasks from “To do” to “Done” was surprisingly motivating.

Impact 💡: It helped me break down my portfolio into manageable steps and stay focused throughout the project, especially when juggling multiple features.
